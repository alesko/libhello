Bug reports:
 Please include enough information for the maintainers to reproduce the
 problem.  Generally speaking, that means:
- the contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug
  and command line invocations of the program(s) involved (crucial!).
- a description of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
- the version number of the program(s) involved (use --version).
- hardware, operating system, and compiler versions (uname -a).
- unusual options you gave to configure, if any (see config.status).
- anything else that you think would be helpful.

Patches are most welcome; if possible, please make them with diff -c and
include ChangeLog entries.

See README-dev for information on the development environment -- any
interested parties are welcome.  If you're a programmer and wish to
contribute, this should get you started.  If you're not a programmer,
your help in writing test cases, checking the documentation against the
implementation, translating the program strings to other languages,
etc., would still be very much appreciated.
